# SnakeGame
Project detail:-
The Snake Game in C++ is a classic arcade-style game where the player 
controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food pellets. The objective is to 
navigate the snake around the game board, avoiding collisions with walls and the 
snake's own body while striving to eat as much food as possible to score points.
